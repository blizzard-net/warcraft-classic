The [Argent Pony Warcraft Client](https://github.com/blizzard-net/warcraft) has been around for a while now, but it does not support developers targeting World of Warcraft Classic.
Now the [Argent Pony Warcraft Classic Client](https://github.com/blizzard-net/warcraft-classic) offers preview support for the [World of Warcraft Classic APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft-classic).
The code is currently a preview release with known issues, but pull requests are welcome to help get it production-ready.
