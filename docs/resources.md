### Developer Portal

The [Blizzard Battle.net Developer Portal](https://develop.battle.net/) has lots of useful information.

- Read the [Getting Started](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/guides/getting-started) guide to create a client and generate your secret.
- The [World of Warcraft Classic](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft-classic) page provides general information about the APIs for World of Warcraft.
There are other pages for other Blizzard games.
- The [Game Data APIs](https://develop.battle.net/documentation/world-of-warcraft-classic/game-data-apis) page lets you use your OAuth client credentials to test API calls and inspect the results.
These are great tools for debugging issues.

### API Discussion

The [Blizzard forums](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/) include an [API Discussion](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/blizzard/c/api-discussion/18) forum with useful content for developers who interact with the APIs.
